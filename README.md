Commands:
This bot uses Discord slash commands.

/set_channel(TextChannel)
This command sets the channel in your server where banshares are posted.

/share_ban(UserID,Reason,Evidence)
This command bans a member and then shares the ban and evidence to all servers that have the bot set up.
UserID and Reason are strings(text), and Evidence is a Discord Attachement (image).
If a user has already been banned prior to using this command, this command will still send share the ban with other servers.
